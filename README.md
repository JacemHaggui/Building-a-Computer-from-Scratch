# Building a Computer from Scratch  

This repository contains my work and progress for the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) course, a project-based journey from building basic NAND logic gates to creating a fully functional computer capable of running Tetris.  

## About the Course  
Nand2Tetris is a hands-on course that takes you through the fundamental concepts of computer science and hardware engineering. By the end, participants will have designed and implemented a computer from scratch, including its hardware architecture, machine language, assembler, virtual machine, and high-level programming language.  

## My Progress  
In this repository, I have documented my solutions to the course's assignments, along with comments explaining my approach. Each folder corresponds to a specific project in the course and contains:  
- **Code**: My implementation of the assigned tasks.  
- **Documentation**: Notes and explanations of my approach.   

## Acknowledgments  
This work represents my learning journey and solutions. I encourage anyone interested in understanding computer science at its core to explore [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org).  

Feel free to explore the repository and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
